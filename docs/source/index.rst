Welcome to the documentation of Geant4-DNA
===================================

The Geant4 general purpose particle-matter Monte Carlo simulation toolkit is being extended with processes for the modeling of biological damage induced by ionising radiation at the DNA scale. Such developments are on-going in the framework of the Geant4-DNA project.
