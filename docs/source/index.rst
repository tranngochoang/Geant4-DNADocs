Welcome to the documentation of Geant4-DNA
===================================

The Geant4 general purpose particle-matter Monte Carlo simulation toolkit is being extended with processes for the modeling of biological damage induced by ionising radiation at the DNA scale. Such developments are on-going in the framework of the Geant4-DNA project. This project was originally initiated by the European Space Agency (ESA). Developments are undertaken by an international collaboration, coordinated since 2008 by the National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics (IN2P3) of the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) in France, in collaboration with the Geant4@IN2P3 activities.
